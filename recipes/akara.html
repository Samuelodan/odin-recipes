    <p>
      These delicious pieces, also known as beans fritters, are said to be of
      Nigerian origin, but can be found in several other African countries. Here
      are all the ingredients you'll need:
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lots of beans</li>
      <li>Peppers</li>
      <li>Crayfish</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Stock cubes</li>
      <li>Diced onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak for about 30 minutes or till the skin swells.</li>
      <li>
        Peel off the beans with your hands (the hard way) or use a blender and
        pulse a couple of times to split the beans (the easy way).
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the peeled beans with your peppers, crayfish, salt, and stock
        cubes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk until the batter becomes airy and fluffy. This will take about a
        minute to 5 minutes depending on the tool you use. Electric hand whisk
        takes about a minute to two, regular hand whisk will take about 2 to 3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the diced onions.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oil and scoop the mixture by spoonfuls into the pan.</li>
      <li>Finally, stir till golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      And that's it, you've now made beautiful Akara. It's often eaten with
      bread so you can try it out. Cheers!
